[build]
  publish = "dist"
  command = "npm run build"

[[headers]]
  for = "/*"
  [headers.values]
    X-Content-Type-Options = "nosniff"

[[headers]]
  for = "/*.js"
  [headers.values]
    Content-Type = "application/javascript; charset=utf-8"

[[headers]]
  for = "/*.mjs"
  [headers.values]
    Content-Type = "application/javascript; charset=utf-8"

[[headers]]
  for = "/assets/*.js"
  [headers.values]
    Content-Type = "application/javascript; charset=utf-8"
```

## Alternative: Add `_headers` file

Or create a `_headers` file in your `public` folder (it will be copied to `dist` during build):
```
/*.js
  Content-Type: application/javascript; charset=utf-8

/*.mjs
  Content-Type: application/javascript; charset=utf-8

/assets/*.js
  Content-Type: application/javascript; charset=utf-8
