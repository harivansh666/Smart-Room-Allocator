**🚀 Classroom Exam Room Allocator | MERN + TypeScript + Docker + Prisma**

Built a **full-stack Classroom & Bench Allocation System** that automates exam seating based on room capacity and teacher assignment. The system allows admins to enter exam details, number of students, and assign teachers — the app auto-generates optimized room + bench allocation.

### 🔧 **Tech Stack**
**Frontend:** React, TypeScript, Zod (form validation)
**Backend:** Node.js, Express.js, TypeScript
**Database:** PostgreSQL + Prisma ORM
**Infrastructure:** Docker (Dockerfile + docker-compose), REST APIs
**Security:** Authentication & Authorization (role-based access control)

### 🧠 **Key Features**
* Admin adds exam details: subject, exam date, number of students, room capacity
* Automatic **room + bench allocation algorithm** for efficient student distribution
* Teacher assignment system with proper relationship mapping (Prisma relations)
* Fully typed end-to-end system using **TypeScript**
* Strong input validation using **Zod** (prevents invalid data)
* Authentication + Authorization (Admin/Teacher roles)
* Dockerized backend for easier deployment
* Clean modular APIs using Express + Prisma
* Error handling using custom middleware & Zod-safe parsing
* Fully responsive UI for admin dashboard

### 📦 **What I Worked On**
* Designed the complete DB schema (User, Room, Teacher relations)
* Wrote backend REST APIs using Express + Prisma
* Implemented Zod validation for all API inputs
* Created frontend admin dashboard in React + TS
* Built dynamic exam room allocation logic
* Set up authentication + role-based authorization
* Containerized app using Docker for production-ready deployment

### 🎯 **Impact**

* Removes manual exam planning work
* Saves time for teachers & admin
* Production-ready structure using modern best practices
